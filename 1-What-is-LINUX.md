## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system based on Unix, widely used across various domains for its stability, security, and flexibility. It serves as the foundation for many servers, desktops, and embedded systems, powering a significant portion of the internet, data centers, and modern computing infrastructure.

## Objectives

After completing this section, students should be able to define and explain the purpose of Linux, open source, Linux distributions, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

## Why Should You Learn About Linux?

Linux is a critical technology for IT professionals to understand due to its extensive use in various fields:

- **Internet and E-commerce**: Most web servers and e-commerce platforms run on Linux.
- **Financial Systems**: Linux is used in point-of-sale systems and global stock markets.
- **Consumer Electronics**: It powers smart TVs, in-flight entertainment systems, and more.
- **Supercomputing**: The majority of the top 500 supercomputers in the world run on Linux.
- **Cloud Computing and Big Data**: Linux is foundational for cloud technologies and big-data solutions.
- **Application Development**: Many applications and their runtimes are hosted on Linux.
- **Interoperability**: IT professionals often need to integrate Linux systems with other environments, such as Microsoft Windows.
- **High Demand**: Linux skills are in high demand in the IT job market.

## What Makes Linux Great?

1. **Open Source Software**: Linux is open-source, allowing users to see, modify, and share its source code, fostering innovation and improvement.
2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Linux's powerful and scriptable CLI simplifies automation, deployment, and system administration.
3. **Modularity**: Linux components can be easily upgraded or replaced, enabling a range of configurations from general-purpose workstations to minimalistic appliances.

## What is Open Source Software?

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can use, study, modify, and share. It promotes collaboration, transparency, and rapid innovation. Key benefits include:

- **Control**: Users can inspect and modify the code.
- **Training**: Developers can learn from real-world code.
- **Security**: Code can be independently reviewed and fixed.
- **Stability**: Open source code remains accessible even if original developers cease support.

### Types of Open Source Licenses

- **Copyleft Licenses**: These licenses, like the GNU General Public License (GPL), ensure that modifications remain open source.
- **Permissive Licenses**: Licenses such as the MIT/X11 license and the Apache Software License 2.0 allow code to be used in proprietary software, promoting code reuse.

## Who Develops Open Source Software?

Open source software development is largely driven by professional developers paid by organizations, alongside volunteers and academic contributors. This collaborative environment fosters dynamic and productive software development.

## Who is Red Hat?

Red Hat is a leading provider of open source solutions, including Linux, cloud, middleware, storage, and virtualization technologies. Red Hat's mission is to drive innovation through open source communities and provide enterprise-ready solutions.

### Red Hat's Role

- **Community Engagement**: Red Hat collaborates with open source communities to develop and stabilize software.
- **Enterprise Support**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) offers long-term support, certifications, and commercial assistance.

### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux

- **Fedora**: A community-driven project sponsored by Red Hat, focused on innovation and the latest software. It is not intended for long-term stability.
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**: A stable, commercially supported distribution based on Fedora, offering long-term support and a robust ecosystem.

## Trying Out Red Hat Enterprise Linux

You can try RHEL by downloading an evaluation copy, through the Red Hat Developer Program, or by deploying an instance via a cloud provider. More information is available on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux "Get Started" page.
