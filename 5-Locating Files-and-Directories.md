The two special directories at the top of the listing refer to the current directory (.) and the parent
directory (..). These special directories exist in every directory on the system. You will discover
their usefulness when you start using file management commands.
Important
File names beginning with a dot (.) indicate hidden files; you cannot see them in the
normal view using ls and other commands. This is not a security feature. Hidden
files keep necessary user configuration files from cluttering home directories. Many
commands process hidden files only with specific command-line options, preventing
one user's configuration from being accidentally copied to other directories or users.
To protect file contents from improper viewing requires the use of file permissions.

The cd command has many options. A few are so useful as to be worth practicing early and using
often. The command cd - changes to the previous directory; where the user was previously to
the current directory. The following example illustrates this behavior, alternating between two
directories, which is useful when processing a series of similar tasks.
[user@host ~]$ cd Videos
[user@host Videos]$ pwd
/home/user/Videos
[user@host Videos]$ cd /home/user/Documents
[user@host Documents]$ pwd
/home/user/Documents

The cd .. command uses the .. hidden directory to move up one level to the parent directory,
without needing to know the exact parent name. The other hidden directory (.) specifies the
current directory on commands in which the current location is either the source or destination
argument, avoiding the need to type out the directory's absolute path name.

/home/user/Videos
[user@host Videos]$ cd .
